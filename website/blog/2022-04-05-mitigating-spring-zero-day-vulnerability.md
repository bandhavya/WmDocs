A new zero-day vulnerability was reported in the Spring library on **29th March 2022**, affecting the library versions **5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19,** and older versions. The vulnerability impacts Spring MVC applications running on JDK 9+. 

Spring has released a new version on **31st March 2022, 5.3.18**, which fixes the vulnerability. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. The [blog post added by Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement) has more details about the vulnerability.

## Is WaveMaker Application Affected?

WaveMaker 10 Apps are compiled using Java 8 and supported to deploy on Java 8 only. So ideally, WaveMaker apps are not affected. Applications deployed on Java 9+ are maybe vulnerable if the controller methods use **@ModelAttribute** or have no annotation. WaveMaker generated controllers either use **@RequestParam**, **@PathParam** or @**RequestBody**. So, they are not affected by this vulnerability. 

:::note
We recommend mitigating your application using one of the steps mentioned below in the blog as an instant fix.  WaveMaker will release a hotfix to include the Spring version update very soon.

## Risk Mitigation

Below are two ways that you can follow to mitigate the risk against CVE-2022-22965 before the scheduled hotfix release.

### Upgrade the Spring Version Manually in your pom.xml

Add the latest version of Spring framework bom **5.3.18** as the first dependency under the `<dependencies>` section of `<dependencyManagement>` section. Add the following dependencies as specified below.

```xml
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-framework-bom</artifactId>
 <version>5.3.18</version>
 <type>pom</type>
 <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

:::note
Ensure it is the first dependency, and it is before the `wavemaker-app-runtime-services` dependency.

### Upgrade Tomcat Version

Upgrade the Tomcat version to either 9.0.62 or 8.5.78, closing the attack vector on Tomcat's side.
